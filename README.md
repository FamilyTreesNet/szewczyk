# Szewczyk

Katarzyna passed away in 1974. Her funeral was during a tremendous snowstorm. Ignacy passed away early September 1973, just weeks before his grandson's wedding Sept. 22, 1973. 

Katarzyna and Ignacy received their marriage license from a courthouse in Springfield, Massachusetts.  

While living in Massachusetts, Katarzyna was a housekeeper at a Catholic Church, where she and another housekeeper hid in a broom closet and witnessed priests coming in late and conducting inappropriate behavior with young women in the kitchen. Ignacy and Katarzyna spent a short time farming in Alabama before settling in Detroit, Michigan. Ignacy worked for the Michigan Central Rail Road, not the PÃ¨re Marquette Railroad. Followed by Ford, then owned a Gulf Gas Station.

Kanczuga is in modern day Poland, about seven miles west
from the Ukraine and twelve miles north of Slovakia.

There is a possibility Ignacy and Katarzyna were married in Europe prior to 1909.

Katarzyna always mentioned Lancut which is about 1.5 miles northwest of Kanczuga. She may have been born there.

Ignacy had a book about Lezajsk which is about 2.5 miles north of Kanczuga. He may have come from Lezajsk.
