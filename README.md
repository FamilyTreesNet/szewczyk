# Katarzyna and Ignacy Szewczyk

Pronounced: Chef Shick  

Grandparents of Gwen, Vivian, Jonathan and Robert  

Katarzyna and Ignacy received their marriage license from a courthouse in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Its possibile Ignacy and Katarzyna were married in Europe prior to 1909. (Note that Ignacy indicated he was married in the ship records.)  

Apparently Katarzyna arrived in the US six years before Ignacy. While living in Massachusetts, Katarzyna was a housekeeper at a Catholic Church, where she and another housekeeper hid in a broom closet and witnessed two priests coming in late and conducting inappropriate behavior with young women in the kitchen.  

Ignacy and Katarzyna spent a short time farming in Alabama before settling in Detroit, Michigan. Ignacy worked for the Michigan Central Railroad, not the PÃ¨re Marquette Railroad. He then worked at Ford before owning a Gulf Gas Station in Centerline, Michigan.
